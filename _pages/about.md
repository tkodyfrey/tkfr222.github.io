Hello! I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Information Science at the University of Kentucky. I'm so glad you're here - Drop me a line at [tkfr222@uky.edu](tkfr222@uky.edu) and let me know you stopped by! 

My research is grounded on two core beliefs: (1) learning environments are unique, contextualized spaces worthy of scholarly attention, exploration, and theorization and (2) humans naturally seek to adapt their behavior in ways that optimize conditions for creating shared meaning, yet many people lack the fundamental skills necessary to strategically and intentionally do so. The intersection of these core beliefs describes a program of research that seeks to advance theoretical understanding of instructional spaces while helping learners and instructors develop communication and technical skills

Classroom Rules, Policies, and Procedures
------
First, my research on classroom rules, policies, and procedures analyzes learners’ perceptions of autonomy-restrictive behavior to help instructors understand why many of their attempts at persuasion, influence, and classroom management may fail. I'm interested in the role of the syllabus in setting classroom expectations and influencing students' reactions, as well as how the enforcement of rules and policies can motivate or demotivate students. Right now, I have several projects planned related to instructor strictness, or the perceived inflexibility of an instructor in relation to classroom rules and norms. Future studies in this area involve examing how strictness interacts with perceived caring to influence motivation, strictness across culturally diverse institutions, and the development of a short form measure of strictness.

Communication and Technical Efficacy for Learners and Teachers
------
Second, my research points to a sustained interest in communication and technical efficacy. Specifically, I am interested in using theory to improve pedagogy in practical ways. For example, we are currently investigating students' expectations for Zoom instruction, how to enhance translational efficacy in biomedical engineering education and practice, measuring public speaking self-efficacy, and ways to improve students' classroom motivation.

Methodological Advances in Instructional Communication Scholarship
------
Last, I'm interested in strategies for implementing instructional interventions in nuanced and sophisticated ways. My work paints a descriptive picture of several approaches that educators or administrates can use to assess to assess and adjust their courses to put students in position for optimal learning. This focus on practical application has led to a reliance on several nuanced research methods (e.g., multilevel modeling) not currently utilized by instructional communication scholars that add statistical precision, accuracy, and scrutiny to existing communication assessment processes. I'm currently working on a three-part study demonstrating the use of MLM for communication assessment and theorizing about classroom communication.
