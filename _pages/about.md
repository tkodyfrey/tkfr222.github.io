Hello! I am an Assistant Professor of Instructional Communication Research and Information Communication Technology in the School of Information Science at the University of Kentucky. 

My research is grounded on two core beliefs: (1) learning environments are unique, contextualized spaces worthy of scholarly attention, exploration, and theorization and (2) humans naturally seek to adapt their behavior in ways that optimize conditions for creating shared meaning, yet many people lack the fundamental skills necessary to strategically and intentionally do so. The connection of these core beliefs describes a program of research that seeks to advance theoretical understanding of instructional spaces while helping learners and instructors develop communication and technical skills

Classroom Rules, Policies, and Procedures
------
First, my research on classroom rules, policies, and procedures analyzes learners’ perceptions of autonomy-restrictive behavior to help instructors understand why many of their attempts at persuasion, influence, and classroom management may fail. I'm interested in the role of the syllabus in setting classroom expectations and influencing students' reactions, as well as how an instructor's strict enforcement of rules and policies can motivate or demotivate students. 

Communication and Technical Efficacy for Learners and Teachers
------
Second, my research points to a sustained interest in communication and technical efficacy. Specifically, I am interested in using theory to improve pedagogy in practical ways. For example, we are currently investigating students' expectations for Zoom instruction, how to enhance translational efficacy in biomedical engineering education and practice, measuring public speaking self-efficacy, and ways to improve students' classroom motivation.

Methodological Advances in Instructional Communication Scholarship
------
Last, I'm interested in teaching others how to use quantitative techniques that answer nuanced research questions and enhance statistical precision. I believe this focus on 0 accessible dissemination of statistical techniques throughout instructional communication literature will embolden scholars to move the discipline forward in exciting ways. Practically speaking, this work also paints a descriptive picture of several approaches that educators or administrators can use to assess to assess and adjust  courses to put students in position for optimal learning and advocate for programs at an administrative level.
