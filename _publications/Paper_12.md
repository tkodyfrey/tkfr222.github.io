Excerpt: Murphy (2012) identified five antecedent skills to reverse mentoring: individual differences, cross- generational differences, willingness to accept role reversals, interaction frequency, and trust and comfort. As educators, we can help Gen Z begin building the necessary skills to effectively communicate digital knowledge to future coworkers, managers, or supervisors without sacrificing learning outcomes for non-traditional students from other generations who are also enrolled in the course. Specifically, the BCC can prepare students for roles as reverse mentors by enhancing 1) communication competence and 2) instructional efficacy.
