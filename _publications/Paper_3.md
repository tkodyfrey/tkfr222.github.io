Abstract: Considering the growth of cell phone usage in the classroom, instructors often attempt to regulate student behavior through specific technology policies in their syllabi. However, research offers little explanation regarding the influence of policies that try to restrict cell phone usage on perceptions of instructor credibility. Using the social influence (SI) model of technology use as a sensitizing lens, results from this study (N = 206) demonstrated that policies encouraging the use of cell phones for instructional purposes resulted in significantly greater student perceptions of instructor credibility than policies discouraging the use of cell phones for noninstructional (i.e. social) purposes.
