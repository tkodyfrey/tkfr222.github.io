Excerpt: The idea of strictness has long been used by students and instructors within the classroom lexicon (e.g., Poplin et al., 2011), even before pandemic pedagogy. Yet, the fields of instructional communication and education seem void of a coherent conceptualization of this ever-present term (Kendall & Schussler, 2012). If educators continue to alter or abolish course policies and procedures in response to the rapid transition to online learning or the impending health crisis, more needs to be understood about the role of strictness in the instructional process. What short- and long-term effects does strictness have on student learning and behavior? How are adjustments to otherwise strict policies and procedures perceived by students? What effect does strictness have on the instructorâ€“ student relationship? To answer important questions like these, we believe this communication concept warrants a clear definition so its impact can be effectively measured, assessed, and interpreted.
