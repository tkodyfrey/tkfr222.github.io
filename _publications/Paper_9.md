Abstract: Basic communication courses (BCCs) are evolving, and technology is a driver of this change. Guided by self-efficacy theory, this study examined the use of virtual reality speaking rehearsals as one technology that instructors can adopt to enhance students’ public speaking efficacy. Students (N = 32) in this study practiced their final informative speeches in virtual reality 360-degree videos. They perceived their efficacy was enhanced in five ways including preparedness, realism, self-awareness, feedback, and comfort level. Conversely, efficacy inhibitors included the lack of presentational aids, technology issues, and lack of audience realism. The results are used to provide practical advice to instructors who would like to implement their own virtual reality rehearsal sessions.
