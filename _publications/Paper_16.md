Abstract: The purpose of this study was to replicate and extend previous work (Chiu, 2021a, 2021b; Vallade et al., 2020) by applying self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985) to student motivation and engagement in the basic communication course during the shift to online learning in the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated that students were most often motivated and engaged through instructor communication and behavior that met their need for relatedness, with a particular emphasis on instructor presence. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed within the context of the basic communication course.
