Abstract: This study investigates the role of speech evaluation training in a) creating speech evaluation fidelity between instructor scores and student self-evaluation scores and b) facilitating the type and quality of written feedback on speeches by both students and instructors. The results suggest that students who undergo speech evaluation training achieve a higher level of evaluation fidelity with their instructors. Second, negative feedback by instructors and students significantly predicted the score provided on the speeches. Finally, students who received speech evaluation training provided significantly more constructive comments on their evaluations than students who did not receive training. These findings reiterate the necessity for speech evaluation training while offering practical implications for revising training methods and preparing individuals for providing effective feedback.
