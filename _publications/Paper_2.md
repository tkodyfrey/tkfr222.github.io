Excerpt: Even in the midst of transitioning to college, millennial students “are often exceedingly close to their parents, who assume participatory roles in their children’s educational pursuits” (Elam, Stratton, & Gibson, 2007, p. 22). Because college years are a complex period traditionally defined by familial, interpersonal, academic, and organizational relationships (Terenzini et al., 1994), a constant, overbearing parental presence may affect students’ expectations for their relationship with their instructors. Thus, this increased sheltering of millennial students may ultimately lead to changing student needs, including a greater focus on the instructor–student relationship, and specifically, rapport (Jorgenson, 1992).
