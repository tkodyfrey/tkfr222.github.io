In order to continue developing teaching and learning in the basic communication course, assessment efforts must seek to evaluate the quality of pedagogical programs relying on criterion-based grading systems. Previous research has already examined the nature of instructor feedback comments and student feedback comments during self-critiques of their own speeches; however, a gap in literature exists regarding whether or not peers should evaluate one another as practice for applying grading criteria that will determine their final scores. Qualitative and quantitative analyses revealed that the classroom context, along with the desire to save positive face, results in students evaluating each otherâ€™s speeches differently than instructors. In terms of the basic course, this finding has implications for the future development of both the basic communication course and speech evaluation training.
