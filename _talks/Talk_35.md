Apart from the fascination surrounding modes of instruction online, educators and researchers
have also begun to raise questions surrounding the practicality and usefulness of etextbooks or
other course alternatives. This panel will feature research investigating the empirical effects of
etextbooks on student learning, as well as a variety of individual perspectives from basic course
directors and administrators who have implemented similar textbook alternatives in their own
courses. The panelists will address unique questions related to the viability of hard copy
textbooks, the utility of e-textbooks, and the acknowledgment of other, lesser-known methods
that may benefit the basic course.
