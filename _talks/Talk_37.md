Despite being a statistically complex technique, MLM poses a variety of advantages, including more precise estimates of student growth, more accurate consideration for individual-differences variables on classroom process, and the possible investigation of contextual effects. Using this particular assessment tool may reveal hidden patterns or answer more complex questions than traditional, aggregated research practice. The DATE session will introduce attendees to this underutilized technique and provide resources for its implementation in the hopes that it can become more widely adopted among communication scholars.
