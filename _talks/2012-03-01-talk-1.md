Students at higher education institutions often find themselves overloaded with many different responsibilities and requirements. Students joining Greek organizations and service groups are just two examples of small groups that emphasize this idea. By examining satisfaction among these groups, we can begin to understand the factors affecting individual fulfillment and how these group experiences can become more beneficial to the overall development of the university. This specific study provides unique and relevant information on current knowledge of satisfaction by examining individual notions of satisfaction produced through negative group experiences. Results indicated that group member perceptions of Productivity significantly predicted an individual’s dissatisfaction with their group experience. At the same time, an individual’s Outside Involvement with group members did not significantly predict dissatisfaction. These results provide practical implications for focusing on group productivity and efficiency when constructing positive group experiences.
