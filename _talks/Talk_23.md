College can be a tumultuous experience. More than ever, the average student encounters challenges such as sexual assault, mental health issues, and concerns about personal safety on campus. While numerous studies elucidate instructor and student self-disclosures in general, sparse literature exists that systematically investigates the far-reaching ramifications of this experience for the parties involved. The aim of this study is to offer a qualitative assessment of student self-disclosures from the perspective of the instructor and to generate theory accounting for the ways in which instructors construct beliefs about professionalism and role responsibility after these disclosures. We incorporate an interpretive grounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to gain a more comprehensive, in-depth understanding of this phenomena.
