This study explores the effects of video speed and instructor behaviors on student outcomes and perceptions. Participants (N = 209) were randomly assigned to one of eight experimental conditions that included the speed of the video, organizational cues used or not used in the video and note taking required or not required.  Participants then completed measures including instructor social presence, sustained attention, cognitive load, affective learning, a recall quiz, and perceived cognitive learning. The students perceived they learn more when watching videos at normal speeds, while listening to the instructor's voiceover with organizational cues, and when taking notes. Results suggest that video speed alone may not be enough to increase either positive (i.e., germane) or negative (i.e., extraneous) cognitive load, however, there are practical strategies to reduce cognitive load that both instructors and students can enact in our ever-changing higher education classrooms.
