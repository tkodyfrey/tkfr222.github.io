Virtual reality (VR) affords users an array of benefits when it comes to confronting apprehensions and improving performance. Given that communication apprehension is often tied to presentations within and beyond the classroom, this mixed methods, longitudinal study examined college student behavioral intentions for VR adoption when using the technology for rehearsing public speaking or presentation assignments. Using the technology acceptance model, our quantitative findings suggest that the perceived usefulness of VR for preparing for final speeches and VR anxiety influence their behavioral intentions to personally adopt VR or recommend the adoption of VR to campus communication centers, friends, or other instructors. Qualitatively, students also discussed perceived usefulness and positive and negative emotional reactions to the technology as facilitators and inhibitors to VR adoption. Based on our findings, several conclusions and implications are suggested for those interested in adopting VR in their own classrooms or for public speaking rehearsals.
