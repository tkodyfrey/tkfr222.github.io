This study explores the extent to which student perceptions of evaluative, regulatory, and interactive instructor strictness predict student intrinsic motivation, interest, and engagement â€” consequential student outcomes that facilitate student learning. In addition, short forms of the instructor strictness scales are forwarded for use in the present study and future research. Results suggest that in most cases, perceptions of instructor strictness decrease student intrinsic motivation, interest, and engagement. Importantly, the magnitude of effects differed depending on the type and nature of the rules, policies, and norms that were enforced (e.g., deadlines, testing, standards). Based on these findings, future directions for the ongoing exploration of instructor strictness are forwarded.
