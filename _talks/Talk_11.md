Using expectancy violations theory as a lens, the current study explored online classroom climate as a mediator of the effect of instructor misbehaviors on both a) credibility and b) affective learning. Results indicated that online classroom climate partially mediated the relationship between instructor misbehaviors and both outcome variables. When students in the distance education classroom perceive a positive classroom climate, the severity of the instructorâ€™s misbehavior is lessened. Despite the effects of their inappropriate misbehaviors, instructors can create an environment in which students can still perceive positive outcomes following a typically unexpected behavior.
