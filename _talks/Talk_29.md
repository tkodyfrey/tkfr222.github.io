This essay provides an argument for the integration of Communication Accommodation Theory (CAT; Giles, 1973) within classroom communication. More specifically, a rationale is provided justifying the benefits of framing instructional communication through a theoretical framework of communication adjustment. The essay begins by overviewing the theoretical history of CAT before synthesizing the existing research concerning either CAT or adjustment within classroom contexts. Finally, several future directions for researchers are identified. Ultimately, researchers from both disciplinary camps have unique experiences and perspectives, both theoretically and methodologically, that will lead to nuanced thinking about communication, adjustment, learning, and identity.
