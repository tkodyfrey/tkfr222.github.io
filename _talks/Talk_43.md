The COVID-19 pandemic presented unique challenges to researchers engaged in qualitative research. Such methods often require the use of in-person methods of data collection and were greatly interrupted during this time of global emergency. Yet, navigating this altered terrain presented opportunities to reflect on the traditional methodological landscape. In this paper, we reflect on the use of Microsoft Teams to facilitate multiple online asynchronous focus groups. We draw on the findings from a study of researchers focused on translational medicine, who work in disparate locations and often have conflicting schedules, to show how the use of this approach facilitated active communication between individuals who otherwise rarely interact. Specifically, we reflect on five ways the technological affordances of Microsoft Teams both enhanced and challenged traditional focus group practice. We consider how (1) conversational sequence, (2) discussion moderation, (3) nonverbal cues, (4) supporting information, and (5) technical competencies relate to using this approach. This results in several reflections intended to help future researchers prepare to facilitate asynchronous online focus groups using Teams. Specifically, we highlight our experiences in terms of participant interaction, iterative reflections, and data management. Ultimately, we argue that this approach adds an important and powerful tool to the qualitative methodological toolkit.
