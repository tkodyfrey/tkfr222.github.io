On August 16, 2016, Brandy Young, a second-grade teacher in Godley, Texas, sent students home with a note informing parents of her intention to eliminate homework as a formal assignment for the school year. Following the posting of the note to Facebook by the mother of one student, Young’s decision to stop assigning homework quickly became a viral sensation featured by news outlets across the country. Using expectancy violations theory (EVT; Burgoon & Hale, 1988), the current case study identified a sample of user-generated comments to a variety of online news reports highlighting Young’s actions. The comments were evaluated based on their positive, negative, or neutral valence to determine the frequency and focus of the general public’s reaction to the story. The practical implications of shifts in traditionally-accepted pedagogy for primary education students, such as the one highlighted herein, are discussed.
