The present needs analysis examines the nature and structure of a training process designed to prepare graduate assistants in their new roles as Speech Laboratory facilitators. Survey data and open ended responses indicate training deficiencies in the following areas: 1) locating the appropriate individual for troubleshooting issues, 2) conducting Speech Lab assessment before and after student visits, and 3) operating necessary audio/video equipment. A revised training plan based on the results is described in detail.
