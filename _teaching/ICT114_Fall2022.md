Composition and Communication in the Digital Age I is the first course in a two-course series designed to teach practical communication skills to students interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The course teaches students to compose and communicate ideas across oral, written, visual, and technological contexts. Specifically, this course will focus on equipping students to (1) translate complex, technical information into understandable terms, (2) utilize research skills to collect and evaluate information, and (3) effectively recognize and adapt behavior in accordance with the expectations for the selected mode of communication.
