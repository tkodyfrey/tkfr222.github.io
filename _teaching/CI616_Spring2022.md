Instructional communication is a blending of three disciplines including pedagogy (teaching), educational and cognitive psychology (learning), and communication. Although each of these unique disciplines is embedded in its own theoretical and research tradition, this course will focus on where these three disciplines intersect. We will examine and criticize various communication and instructional models, along with the programs of research produced from these models, plan for and deliver instruction in both in-person and computer-aided venues, learn various methods for assessing teaching and learning, and discuss the managerial and political aspects of instructional delivery in various professional contexts, with a special emphasis on those in academic, information, and organizational settings. Seminar topics will include student learning, the transactional nature of teacher-student communication, and instructional communication theory building.
