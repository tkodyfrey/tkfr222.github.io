CIS 112 is an accelerated version of the standard two-semester composition and communication sequence. It focuses on integrated oral, written, and visual communication skill development and emphasizes critical inquiry and research. Students will sharpen their ability to conduct research; compose and communicate in written, oral, and visual modalities, and use interpersonal skills to work effectively in groups (dyads and small groups).

This specific section of CIS 112 is designed to teach practical communication skills to students interested in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). In addition to the goals stated above, this course will focus on equipping students to (1) translate complex, technical information into understandable terms, (2) utilize research skills to collect and evaluate information, and (3) effectively recognize and adapt behavior in accordance with the expectations for the selected mode of communication.
